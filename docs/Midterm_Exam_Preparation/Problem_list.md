### Problem List in Slides

- How to present pseudocode?
1. Input&Output
2. Function Name(Arguments):
3. if statement then ;
4. else .... endif
5. while ... do ... end while / for ... do ...end for
6. a <- a+b
7. return 
8. end

- What are the two main categories of data structure?
Linked Structure:
1. Insertion/deletion are simple and fast
2. Moving pointers is faster than moving the actual data
3. Random access it not allow.
4. Very flexible, more complex , poor cache locality.

Continous data structures:
1. No extra space wasted for the pointer field
2. Efficient random access is possbile
3. Better memory locality and cache performance.

- What is a greedy algorithm?

A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic strategy that makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope that these local choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.


- Describe the divide and conquer strategy?

- How is the Union-Find data structure working?
