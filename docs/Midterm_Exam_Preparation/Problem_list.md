3. if statement then ;
4. else .... endif
5. while ... do ... end while / for ... do ...end for
6. a <- a+b

- What are the two main categories of data structure?
Linked Structure:
1. Insertion/deletion are simple and fast
2. Moving pointers is faster than moving the actual data
3. Random access it not allow.

Continous data structures:
1.
2.
3.
- What is a greedy algorithm?

- Describe the divide and conquer strategy?

- How is the Union-Find data structure working?


### Problem List

- Pros and Cons of continuous and linked data structures

Continous data structures

- No extra space wasted for the pointer field
- Efficient random access is possbile
- Better memory locality and cache performance.
